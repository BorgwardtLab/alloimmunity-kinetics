# Analysis of alloimmunity kinetics of patients on the waiting list

This repository contains the code to generate the figures in the manuscript "Pre-transplant kinetics of anti-HLA antibodies in patients on the kidney transplant waiting list".

If the rendering by GitHub fails (i.e. the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" appears), you can visualize any of the jupyter notebooks by copying their URLs in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.
